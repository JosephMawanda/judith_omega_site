                    <h2>My Thirty Minutes Experience In Kempton Park Johannesburg As A Conductor</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Through out mynO'level times, iwas avlid deicated reader of
                         the mine boy novel by PETER ABRAHAMNS one 
                         of favourite writers among many others</p>

                    <p>Mine boy was that beautiful novel that iwould read and feel as though
                         its real and out of curiosity, ihad the
                         desire to visit south africa especially the  mines, 
                         just to remind myself of XUMA the mine boy.</p>

                    <p>As usual, in life we all have prayers we want God to
                         answer, wishes we want to come true  and dreams we want to wake up to. 
                         In my case of those dreams and or wishes was to ever make it to 
                         Johannesburg and visit the mines in memory of XUMA and BOOm,
                        there it was. chance to travel to jburg to see the mines. Iwas happy.
                         Iwas riding on a horse on cloud9</p>

                    <p>Shortly iwas ready for my Trip.</p>
                    <p>It was 2 am southa frican time when ET landed at OR.Tambo International AirPort,
                         my ride who thought i speak zulu was right There waitingb for me. "Kunjani??",
                          he said. i remeber looking at him as though i knew each and every word he said.
                           i gave him this facial expression of  " hey, its okay lets just go". 
                            I didnt speak Zulu but if felt like i was anative
                             of PRETORIA with probably additional language knowladge in Tseswana.</p>

                    <p>Iwas ready to roll through Soweto Ghettos</p>
                    <p>Ijumped in the car and ys there iwas arrived at KEMPTON PARK Johannesburg. 
                        In the hotel, too anap and woke to the beauty of the area.
                         it was 3hours when i woke up and realixed i didnt have RAND.
                          I then stepped out to look for the nearest forex 
                          exchange but unfortunatly when i got one, 
                          i didnt have neither a passport or the incountries national identification. i could not change without valid documentation
                        so i had to go back to the htel and pick my passport 
                        for easy and secure transactions but again by the time i reached the hotel and back,
                         it eas past their working hours, They were closed And i was stuck.
                          I only had $ and thta was not going to help things locally</p>

                    <p>I ventually get help from a securty guard who told me to go to OR.TAMBO since
                     they work 24hours. thank God OR.tambo was not far. 
                     i went there, successfully perfomed my transastion and onmy way
                      back... HELL just happened</p>

                      <p>Back at home in uganda, when you get into a matatu,
                           conductors collect money from passengers and thats what igrew up seing,
                            knowing and doing. So now i have some rand on me and 
                            time to view the city and see if i can go round kempt
                         while enjoying pretorias comfy matatus. havin that in mind,
                     i jumped right to the front seat right next to the 
                co-driver and yes, iwas ready to view the streets.
                 but one thing i didnt know was that unlike uganda,
                 southafricans dont hire conductors to get money from passengers. that money is collected by
                anyone that attempts to sit on the co-drivers seat and in most cases they are me.</p>

                <p>Now here iam, on the front seat, a woman,
                     a foreigner and worse enough not familiar with Rands. then , 
                     that money is actually collected before the matatu sets off. me seated comfortably on the front, money started 
                     shooting towards and iwas looking at these guys 
                     hands like whaaat? i dont collect money... 
                     "sicela uqoqe le mali" (please collect that money).
                     i looked at the driver, he looked back at me and smiling. can you imagine? i expected him to say something,
                      but he didnt. hands were still shooting from the back, hey get this money. in my confused state, i started to collect 
                      the money but i didnt even know the rand denominations and while iwas still collecting
                      ,guys who gave me the money first wanted their change 
                      and honestly at this point am stuck coz i dont even know how much the trip costs.</p>

                      <p>I think the driver knew i was a foreigner
                           coz he never stopped looking at me with a facial expression that asked where
                         iwas from. I dont know how and i dont remember how but imanaged to get guys their
                          change back and finally the matattu set off to kempton park</p>

                    <p>Damn! iwas out of myself. 
                        me who was happily looking foward to visit the mines, was now a conctor
                     collectong money from passengers. cant be!</p>

                     <p>It was qiet an experince for
                          me and i vowed never to use buplic means in a foreigner country.
                           ill always try to get a taxi coz that experince was not good. my mines vibe was killed.
                         yes i stiil navigated the ghettos but not withvigar that i went with.</p>
